title: 'A Pitfall: Child Goroutines Causing Service Crashes'

## Background

Recently, during microservice development, I encountered a very dangerous issue. We were using the `echo` framework, and in a `handler`, we launched a goroutine via `errgroup`. However, when a panic occurred inside that goroutine, even though we had added the `Recover` middleware to protect the service process, **the entire service still crashed**, causing all users sharing the same server to have their requests aborted.

This exposed a very common but easily overlooked pitfall:  
> **`defer recover` cannot handle panics inside child goroutines.**

---

## Issue Reproduction

You can reproduce this behavior by running [this code](https://go.dev/play/p/bUHg8lPsUPn):

```go
package main

import (
 "context"
 "fmt"

 "golang.org/x/sync/errgroup"
)

func TestPanicRecovered() {
 defer func() {
  if r := recover(); r != nil {
   fmt.Println(r)
  }
 }()
 panic("panic")
}

func TestPanicRecoverFailed() {
 defer func() {
  if r := recover(); r != nil {
   fmt.Println(r)
  }
 }()

 g, _ := errgroup.WithContext(context.TODO())
 g.Go(func() error {
  panic("panic")
 })
 err := g.Wait()
 fmt.Println(err)
}

func main() {
 TestPanicRecovered()
 TestPanicRecoverFailed()
}
```

In `TestPanicRecovered`, `defer-recover` successfully catches the panic. However, in `TestPanicRecoverFailed`, even with `recover` placed in the parent goroutine, **the panic inside the child goroutine still causes a crash**.

## Why Echo's Recover Middleware Not Work?

Let's take a look at Echoâ€™s Recover middleware implementation ([source code](https://github.com/labstack/echo/blob/de44c53a5b16f7dca451f337f7221a1448c92007/middleware/recover.go#L85-L130)):

```go
// RecoverWithConfig returns a Recover middleware with config.
// See: `Recover()`.
func RecoverWithConfig(config RecoverConfig) echo.MiddlewareFunc {
 // Defaults
 if config.Skipper == nil {
  config.Skipper = DefaultRecoverConfig.Skipper
 }
 if config.StackSize == 0 {
  config.StackSize = DefaultRecoverConfig.StackSize
 }

 return func(next echo.HandlerFunc) echo.HandlerFunc {
  return func(c echo.Context) (returnErr error) {
   if config.Skipper(c) {
    return next(c)
   }

   defer func() {
    if r := recover(); r != nil {
     if r == http.ErrAbortHandler {
      panic(r)
     }
     err, ok := r.(error)
     if !ok {
      err = fmt.Errorf("%v", r)
     }
...
```

As you can see, it only captures **panics that occur inside the current HTTP request goroutine**. **Panics that occur in child goroutines are completely out of reach of the middleware.**

According to the [official Go documentation](https://go.dev/blog/defer-panic-and-recover#:~:text=The%20process%20continues%20up%20the%20stack%20until%20all%20functions%20in%20the%20current%20goroutine%20have%20returned%2C%20at%20which%20point%20the%20program%20crashes.):

```txt
The process continues up the stack until all functions in the current goroutine have returned, at which point the program crashes.
```

**A panic can only be recovered inside the same goroutine stack where it occurred.** Otherwise, the panic will propagate upward, and eventually cause the entire program to crash.

## Solution

0. As of April 28, 2025, the latest `errgroup` still does not automatically recover from panics inside functions, it is still highly recommended to manage goroutines through `errgroup` (or similar mechanisms) in your handler. This way, you can easily wrap each task with a recover mechanism, ensuring graceful error handling.

1. The [official errgroup](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/53757) has already fixed this issue in the master branch, but the fix has **not been officially released** yet.

2. In the meantime, you can check out my [safegroup](https://github.com/akishichinibu/safegroup). It automatically wraps each task with a safe `recover` mechanism and provides a type-safe way to handle `panic` errors.
